Q. What's one time you worked with a difficult customer and how did you handle the situation

Situation: I was assigned into a project just after joining Infosys which involved the development  of a government of India web portal along with integration of legacy data which they stored in Oracle. The tech stack we were using was DB2. The customer was a very eager one and also they had influence on the awarding of other future projects as well. I was leading a team of 2 developers to develop one of the components

Task: Due to some kind of miscalculation on the part of the sales team, the timeline for completion of the project was decided to be 6  months. After technical  analysis, the dev team rea;ized that even with very strict timelines the release would at least take 1 year. This also involved the modules I was working on. Customer was informed about it, the customer was very unhappy of the situation.

Action: For the module I was working on, I broke down the timelines to a more detailed form. As every major milestone was reached, the customer was provided a walkthrough so that they could see the progress of the module. We had frozen the requirements so the feedback receieved was mostly any deviation in the functionality and also if any changes were recommended this was being sent as change requests.

Result: Though the project could not be completed as per the timeline however due to constant communication, the customer had a good feedback when the final deliverable was completed.
