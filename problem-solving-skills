 Q. Describe the project or situation that best demonstrates youor prooblem-solving abilities. What was your role and impact in this project ?

Situation: As  a freelancer, I was hired by a startup team to assist with the database activities. , the legacy database was heavily denormalized and was performing very slow even though the amount of data was quite small, around 100 Mb.  

Task: The front end was running very slow whenevr any data was being fetched from the backend.  Reports were planned to run on the data however database structure caused the reports to run for ever and ever. Being a startup, they didnt have much documentation of the data structure for me to get any idea without going hands on

Action: After I received access to the database, i ran execution plans for queries which gave me a fairly good idea of the issues which needed to be fixed.  Going more deeper into the structures also provided further understanding of the data. I arranged multiple sessions with my POC and explained them my understanding. I also provided them an outline of the course of action I plan to take. As they wanted to have reports run on the database, I designed  the database which could help them cater to the requirements.I also helped them to have some documentation so that they can be used in future.

Result: The performance of the website was increased by almost 25% with few changes. After the full scale database refresh, they could perform their task much faster and much easily. They could integrate their database to a popular reporting service without much tweaks and with very good performance.
