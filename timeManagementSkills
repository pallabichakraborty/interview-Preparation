Q. Tell me a time when you had to juggle between multiple projects/tasks at workplace and how did you prioritize.

Situation: When I was working as a technology lead in Infosys, I had mutiple responsibilities assigned to me. I had to lead a team of 4 core developers, extra developers being assigned as need be. I was provided work where I was supposed to contribute as individual contributor as well.

Task: Leading a team of developers means I was expected to be thorough of the deliverables being delivered by them along with ensuring good quality. This task could be entirely different from the work being expected from me as a individual contributor.

Action: I classified my work into  priorities mostly based on the upcoming timelines keeping some buffer time for unknowns which becomes a frequent occurence if someone is working in agile environment. I would start my day earlier than most of the team around, this is the time I would do the tasks which needed critical thinking and quite office if possible. Again  the highest priority work of this sort is something I took up first and proceed to lower priorities in the same fashion. The day time typically needs a lot of code reviews, troubleshooting etc for the team, this can be taken when everyone is in. I also referred to my manager to validate if they would want to prioritize any activity which is lower in my priority list, this way my manager would not have any false expectation of what would be delivered and what not.  

Result: Managing my time helped in having a peaceful mind along with setting right expectstions by my manager and the developers working for me. I could also become an example on how the new resources could start and work on prioritizing their time.
