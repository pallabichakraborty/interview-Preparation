Q. Tell me about a time you had to do something you had never done befoe. How did you approach this situation, and what did you learn?
Situation : After the completion of my masters, I  worked as an intern for a company which was developing their website along with the backend integration with the database. They wanted a 4-5 pages webpages along with a portal where they were also doing some amount of data entry pertaining to their consulting business. The tech stack being used was HTML, ReactJS and mySQL.
Task: I had to start building the front end code, build templates which could be easily utilized for development of standardized pages. This was done keeping in mind that there may be further pages added as and when needed. The only challenge with this was that I had never ever worked on Front End. Being a database programmer, I was proficient enough to be able to create APIs and java microservices however the javascript platform was new to me and the need of the hour was to have as short of a learning curve as possible.
Action: First of all, I set the expectations with the manager responsible for the deliverables. As I had to begin from scratch, I started right from learning how to develop simple HTML f took up a udemy course to learn ReactJS, did various projects available in the open source code. As i got more proficient with the language, i registered to various user forums where articles with new advancements were published, thus optimizing the coding work.
Result: Not only i was able to deliver my code on time with good quality, it also became a value add to my proficiencies thus helping me to get a overall perspective of the front end development. This helps to even deliver Database programs of better quality as I understand how the data that i deliver would be utilized by other developers.
