Q. Tell me a time when you built a strong relationship with a difficult client.


Q. Tell me about a time when you had to work with a coworker you did not like or trust you

Situation: During a project while working as an individual contributor in Infosys,  I was coordinating witha colleague working from a different location. My module was ingesting data from the output from the module my colleague was developing. 

Task: The deliverables were time bound. My colleague seemed to be over committing on the tasks which caused confusion in my work. When I planned my work with the commitment he was providing, I would have things pending from his end and I would be stuck with my work even though I would have stayed late to keep up with the timelines he had provided.

Action: I decided to speak to the colleague of mine to understand if there were any impediments which causing his delays. I offered to help him and also set up a meeting with the lead managing the project. After careful discussion, the colleague of mine was provided with an extra resource to help him with his activity. Also I  created a dashboard which would give a better idea of the actual work completed instead of guessing.

Result: We were able to deliver the compoments on time and with good quality and also with lesser friction than what would have arisen otherwise.
